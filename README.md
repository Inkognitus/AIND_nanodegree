# [Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889)
A repository of multiple projects and labs done in the Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree (aind).

### [Sudoku](/aind-sudoku)

In this project, we will be writing code to implement two extensions of our sudoku solver. The first one will be to implement the technique called "naked twins". The second one will be to modify our existing code to solve a diagonal sudoku. To complete this project we will use the tools we learned about in the lesson, and build upon them.

### [Build A Game-Playing Agent (Isolation)](/aind-isolation)

In this lesson, we'll build a Game-Playing agent that defeats opponents in Isolation. Along the way, we'll learn about advanced Game-Playing techniques such as Minimax, Iterative Deepening, and Alpha-Beta Pruning.

### [Lab: Build a Pacman playing agent](/aind_Pacman)

In this lab, we'll use depth-first search, breadth-first search uniform-cost search and A* search to build a pacman game playing agent who can find the shortest way through the maze to the goal and reach there.
